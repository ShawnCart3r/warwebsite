                    The galaxy burns under the shadow of the Nightmaric Virus, a weapon of unspeakable horror unleashed by Persephone, the Queen of Nightmares. Entire civilizations fall as the virus twists the living into monstrous tools of her will, their humanity consumed. Planets become graveyards, fleets vanish into darkness, and the stars themselves seem to dim as her conquest spreads unchecked.

The war is total. No corner of the galaxy is spared as Persephone’s generals—beings of unimaginable cruelty—lead relentless campaigns, reducing thriving worlds to ash. Refugees flee from dying systems, while fractured alliances struggle to mount a defense. But even in the face of annihilation, defiance endures.

A fragile coalition rises, uniting sworn enemies and ancient rivals under a banner of desperation. Among them, the Shadows, ancient warriors torn by internal strife, fight to preserve what remains. Yet, for every victory, Persephone’s forces adapt, growing stronger, more relentless, more unstoppable.

Amid the chaos, whispers spread of a young woman named Cassandra, an enigma at the heart of the galaxy’s greatest conflict. She is neither soldier nor savior, yet her actions ripple through the war, challenging the inevitability of Persephone’s dominion.

The Nightmaric War is a battle for the soul of the galaxy. As hope flickers and the darkness deepens, the question remains: can anything survive the storm, or will Persephone’s vision of a galaxy drowned in nightmares become reality?
