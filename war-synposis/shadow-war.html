                            In the twilight of Earth’s golden age, the Shadows were its protectors—beacons of hope in an unstable world. They wielded powers that bridged humanity and the divine, binding nations together under their guidance. But unity is fragile, and as ideals clashed, the Shadows shattered. The *Shadow War* was born, and the Earth would never be the same again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Skies once alive with innovation turned dark with ash. Cities once brimming with life fell to ruin. The world’s last protectors became its greatest threat, and humanity found itself caught between titans of conflicting ideals. In this broken world, survival was no longer a right—it was a war of attrition.

                            The *Shadow War* was fought across a shattered Earth, with its scars becoming part of the planet’s identity. In the **Siege of Tokyo**, Theresa’s forces fortified the city into an unbreakable fortress, but Darkness’s armies turned it to rubble.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The **Shattered Pacific Campaign** poisoned Earth’s oceans, while the **Bleeding Forest** saw guerrilla fighters battling bioengineered horrors in the dying Amazon rainforest.

                            Nations fractured under the Shadows’ war, their people scattering into fractured alliances. Earth’s landscapes transformed into battlegrounds:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li class="list-item"><strong>The Iron Grave:</strong> Africa’s savannas became scorched wastelands under Darkness’s mechanized legions.</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><strong>The Skyreach Zones:</strong> High-tech cities once celebrated for innovation became fortified strongholds for Theresa’s forces, crumbling under siege.</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><strong>The Black Oceans:</strong> Earth’s seas, poisoned by the Shattered Pacific Campaign, turned hostile to life, their waters hiding wreckage and monsters.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Civilization didn’t just collapse—it evolved. Small enclaves formed from the ashes, clinging to scraps of technology, hoping the Shadows’ war would end before humanity itself disappeared.

                            The war culminated in the **Battle of New York**, where Theresa and Darkness clashed in their final confrontation. Their powers tore the city apart, threatening to annihilate what little remained of Earth. As the chaos reached its peak, it was **Veronica** who stepped forward to end the war. Guided by Cassandra, she delivered the final blow—not to destroy, but to stop.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            History would remember Theresa as the victor and Darkness as the villain. But the truth—Veronica’s quiet heroism—was known only to Cassandra and a select few. Veronica faded into obscurity, her actions unacknowledged, while the world began the slow process of rebuilding amidst the ruins.
